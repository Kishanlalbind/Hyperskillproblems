problem statment=>For its input, the program gets a sequence of non-negative integers; each integer is written in a separate line. The sequence ends with an integer 0; when the program reads 0, it should end its work and output the length of the sequence (not counting the final 0).

Donâ€™t read numbers following the number 0.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // put your code here
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int value;
        int count = 0;
        do {
            value = scanner.nextInt();
            count++;
        } while (value != 0);
        
        System.out.println(count - 1);
    }
}
